Project hit many delay and finally when on Hold in 15 Dec 2017 and has been kick start 18 Feb 2018.

##Reasons for Delay:

###Learning of Technology: 
Project was to be build on React Native which was unknown to developer. Lot of time spend in Tutorial online, some of the code was not fully usable which was learnt

###Start Stop Development:
Development was not continues. Was starting and stoping due personal reasons of developer.

###Sole Developer:
Everything depended on one developer and personal problem would stop project from progress

###No Preset Budget Pool:
There is no Preset Budget where resource could be purchase in time of need which made the project keep looking for free options delay the development.

###Design & Logo:
No set Logo or Design kept making the design approach lot when building the app and cause loss of focus
